  "body": "# A Single Source\r\n\r\nThis book describes a fully–automated method of electronic edition.\r\n\r\nTaking a real–world case, I explain what is and what implies working with digital texts.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, _A Single Source_ isn’t available yet in English. Only its Spanish version, [_Un solo origen_](http://www.un-solo-origen.tk) has been released.\r\n\r\nIt may take some time, because there are some issues which should be fixed first.\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nMy aim with this work is to show how a professional method of electronic editing could be achieved following this basic principle:\r\n\r\n> One source to generate them all.\r\n\r\nThis document generation from a single source may be achieved using `pandoc`. But I’m afraid that `pandoc` has some issues that discourage its adoption by a wider audience.\r\n\r\nThese are the issues that should be fixed first, [before learning `pandoc` would make sense](http://www.learn-pandoc.tk).\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\nIf you have anything to share, please open [an issue](https://github.com/ousia/a-single-source/issues/new).\r\n\r\nCommenting requires a _GitHub_ account. And don’t forget that all comments are public.",
